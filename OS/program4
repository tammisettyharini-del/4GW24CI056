In this program:

We create a named pipe (FIFO) using mkfifo.
The writer process opens the FIFO for writing (O_WRONLY), writes messages entered by the user to the FIFO using write, and then closes the FIFO.
The reader process opens the FIFO for reading (O_RDONLY), reads messages from the FIFO using read, and prints them to the console.
The communication between the writer and reader processes is achieved through the named pipe. Each process can read from or write to the pipe independently.
The program continues running indefinitely until manually terminated.
Compile and run the program, and you can enter messages in the writer process, which will be read and displayed by the reader process.
